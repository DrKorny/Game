	<p>You are a great potato. You leave the safe village and travel through the lands of South-Earth until you reach a giant forest. You have to decide if you wanna go THROUGH the forest or take a longer route and AVOID the forest. If you don't like adventures you could also walk BACK to the village...but that's lame, right?</p>

There are not too many Orcs so you could have a chance but fighting against 20 Orcs might be a bit risky. But if you can talk properly you could maybe find another solution. So what's next ? </p></tt>
